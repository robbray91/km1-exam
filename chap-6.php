        <h2>Build or Buy?</h2>

        <h2>1. Software Maintenance and Enhancement - What's That?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Like caring for a pet or plant.</li>
            <li>Software (apps or programs) needs looking after and improving.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Support and Upgrades - How They Help:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>"Support" is like asking parents for homework help.</li>
            <li>Experts help when you have problems through phone or email.</li>
            <li>Updates add new features, like leveling up in a game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Advantages of Ready-made Software:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ready-made software is like buying a game from the store.</li>
            <li>You can try before buying, just like testing a new game.</li>
            <li>Saves you from making everything from scratch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Disadvantages of Ready-made Software:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ready-made software might not do everything you want.</li>
            <li>You might need to tweak it, like using old shoelaces with new shoes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Ownership and Risks:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Making your own software is like crafting unique art.</li>
            <li>You own it entirely.</li>
            <li>Buying software means the company owns it and decides what happens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Financial and Competitive Stuff:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ready-made software saves money upfront, but may have later costs.</li>
            <li>Doesn't give you a competitive edge, like playing the same game as friends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Open Source - A Different Way:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Open source is like sharing and customizing a recipe.</li>
            <li>You can change open source software as you like, similar to creating game levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Open Source Risks:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You're in charge of making open source software work.</li>
            <li>May not get as much help as with ready-made software, like cooking without a recipe guide.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In summary, software maintenance and enhancement are like taking care of computer programs. You can buy ready-made ones or create your own, each with advantages and things to be cautious about.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Component-based Development</h2>

        <p>Think of computer programming like LEGO building, with two main approaches: bespoke (unique) or ready-made pieces. Component-based development is the third way, using pre-made components as building blocks. Components are like black boxes with external instructions. They can be in different languages and work on various computers.</p>

        <p>Components have an inside (how they work) and an outside (how to use them). Combine them like LEGO pieces to create new things. Some offer services, and others use these services. Components vary in size, from tiny and versatile pieces to complete applications. You can even add components made by others.</p>

        <p>Components can be open-source (modifiable) or closed (unmodifiable). Whole software products can be used as components for larger solutions, like using a LEGO set within a bigger creation.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Development Methodologies</h2>

        <h3>1. Starting a Project:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a computer program or game is like baking cookies; you need a plan.</li>
            <li>"Development methodologies" are like recipes for success in the computer world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Common Methodology Parts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lifecycle</strong>: It's the big plan that breaks down all the steps from start to finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Process</strong>: Explains what to do at each step, like deciding on characters and levels in game design.</li>
            <li><strong>Roles</strong>: Like assigning jobs to people in a team, e.g., designing characters or writing code.</li>
            <li><strong>Deliverables</strong>: These are things you make at each step, such as character sketches or code pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Techniques</strong>: These are the methods or tools used, similar to using a rolling pin to flatten cookie dough.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Two Types of Methodologies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Defined Processes</strong>: It's like a strict recipe with clear steps and predictability, but can be a bit too strict.</li>
            <li><strong>Empirical Processes</strong>: More like experimenting, allowing for changes as you go, and being flexible and creative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Agile Methodology:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Agile is all about flexibility and working closely with users.</li>
            <li>It's like baking cookies with friends where you can adjust the recipe as you bake.</li>
            <li>Popular for making computer programs due to its adaptability and improvements as you go.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Choosing the Right Recipe:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When making your program, pick a methodology that fits your project.</li>
            <li>Some are strict, like following a set plan, while others are more like experimenting and being creative.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Software Engineering Paradigms</h2>

        <h3>1. Structured Programming (SP):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Idea</strong>: Imagine writing a story; you want it to be easy to read.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Structured programming is like organizing your story into paragraphs, each with a clear beginning and end. It makes your story easier to understand.</li>
            <li><strong>In Programming</strong>: It means breaking down your code into smaller parts with clear instructions like "if this happens, do that." This makes your program more organized and easier to work on.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Object-Oriented Development (OOD):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Idea</strong>: Think of objects as building blocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: In your game or program, you have different objects like characters, cars, or items. Each object has its own unique abilities (like jumping or shooting), and they can talk to each other to make the whole game work.</li>
            <li><strong>In Programming</strong>: It's like building a game with LEGO pieces, where each piece does something specific. This makes it easier to create and maintain your game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Service-Oriented Development (SOD):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Idea</strong>: It's like ordering food online.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: When you order a pizza, you don't need to know how the pizza is made. You just tell the pizza place what you want, and they deliver it to you.</li>
            <li><strong>In Programming</strong>: Different parts of your program (services) work together, but they don't need to know how each other works. They just send messages to get the job done. It's like using different apps on your phone that can talk to each other without knowing how the others work.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In all of these approaches, the goal is to make creating software easier, more organized, and efficient. It's like having a clear plan when you build something, whether it's a story, a game, or even ordering a pizza online!</p>

        <h2>The Influence of Technological Advances</h2>

        <h3>1. Cloud-Based Technology:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Imagine using computer programs and services not just on your computer but from anywhere on the internet. That's cloud computing.</li>
            <li>Three types: SaaS (online apps), PaaS (deploying apps in the cloud), IaaS (providing power, storage, and network for cloud software).</li>
            <li>Together, they form the cloud computing stack, hosted online instead of on your computer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. On-Demand Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Picture it like streaming a movie. On-demand software lets you use apps whenever you need, paying only for what you use.</li>
            <li>Saves money, no need to buy software for each device. Updates and maintenance are managed centrally.</li>
            <li>Example: Microsoft's Office 365 lets you use Office apps online without installing them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Model-Driven Architecture (MDA):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Making computer programs without writing code manually. You use design models, like blueprints.</li>
            <li>MDA automatically turns these models into actual programs, speeding up development and reducing errors.</li>
            <li>It's like creating a plan, making it detailed, adapting it to your computer, and then generating the actual program code.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Overall Impact:</strong> These tech advances make things more convenient, cost-effective, and efficient in the world of computers and software.</p>
